Returning champions, Meg, Logan, and Aurora discuss local ballot initiatives across the U.S. including carbon emissions fees, proactive water pollution prevention in Montana, fish protections in Alaska, a combo bill that intertwines vaping and off-shore drilling, and more! As an added bonus, the crew unveils their Halloween costumes for this year—and Aurora’s is quite spooky. Check it out in our photos.

Also, Logan conducts his first interview with Chris Bowman, a graduate student at Michigan. Check out more details below:

 

Over the summer, Chris Owen served as an intern for the Rocky Mountain Institute, a prestigious Colorado-based nonprofit organization which brands itself as a think-and-do tank. He got plugged-in to distribution grid work with solar energy cooperatives of which there are just shy of 1000 in the United States. Specifically, Bowman focused his efforts on expanding and hastening the transition to renewable energy using market forces.

Now in the Fall, Owen is back at Michigan continuing his graduate education as a proud, “Erber”. The Erb Institute is a dual-degree program where students earn an MBA from the Ross School of Business and a master’s from the School for Environment and Sustainability (SEAS) over the course of three years. Owen joined the program to gain a deeper understanding of the business, economics, and politics that set the stage for renewable energy markets to perform successfully. He speaks with fervor about the broadening transition to renewables as Logan poses a wide range of questions from front-of-the-meter generation to greater moral imperatives.
