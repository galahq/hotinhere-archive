###### One time, at a party in Ann Arbor...

Fela Kuti's tune _[Let's Start](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zWRjgathjA)_ began to play on [88.3 WCBN | FM | Ann Arbor.](http://www.wcbn.org/)  Unbeknownst to everyone, It's Hot in Here was born.

Putting that knowledge in conversation with practice in Detroit, Ann Arbor and the World, It's Hot in Here ushered in a new era in eco-optimistic college talk radio, with local and global music to boot.

Ten years and over two hundred live shows later, a seed that started off as a joke at that party grew into a family of friends, research specialists, activists, policy makers, artists, journalists and more.
