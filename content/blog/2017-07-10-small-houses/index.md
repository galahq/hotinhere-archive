[![](images/lloydkhan-216x300.jpg)](http://www.hotinhere.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/lloydkhan.jpg)His most recent book is "[Small Homes: The Right Size](https://www.shelterpub.com/building/small-homes)" a recent book detailing the recent housing trend of small homes. Small Homes are houses that are larger than "tiny", but smaller than the national average. They are typically energy efficient and cheap to produce and maintain. His new book details over 60 of them, and is complete with interior and exterior photographs.

This is a fascinating episode of It's Hot in Here, and we're glad to give listeners a chance to listen to an expert on the growing phenomenon of small homes.
