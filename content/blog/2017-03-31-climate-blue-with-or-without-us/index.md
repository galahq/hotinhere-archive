On this week's episode of It's Hot in Here, hosts _Malavika Sahai_ and _Chris Askew-Merwin_ are joined in studio by returning guest, _Ed Waisanen_, and first-time guest _Connor Rubin_ who were both delegates at the COP 22 this past year in Marrakech, Morroco (for an in-depth recap on COP 22 check out this [IHIH episode](http://www.hotinhere.us/podcast/cop-22-in-marrakech/) on the conference with _Ed Waisanan_ and _Ember McCoy_)_._ We discuss a recent event, called _With or Without US?_, hosted by Climate Blue, a University of Michigan student group that sends delegations of students to attend the yearly United Nations climate climate change conference called the Conference of Parties. The event was composed of  talks given by student delegates and an expert panel on the future of climate change action at the international, national, and local levels. We chat with _Ed_ and _Connor_ about their experiences and the topics they chose to present at the event. _Connor_ regails us with a discussion on the "hidden figures" of the climate change movement and _Ed_ educates us on the importance of "loss and damages" in climate change negotiations. Then we listen to selected clips from the expert panel and discuss the strategies and views of those phenomenal leaders. And all the while, playing stone-cold grooves.
