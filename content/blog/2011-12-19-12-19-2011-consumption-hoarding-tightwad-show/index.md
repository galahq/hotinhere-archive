Consumption is nec­es­sary for survival but also produces negative con­se­quences for human health, society, and the envi­ron­ment. Research across domains (addic­tion, obesity, debt, consumer behavior, material waste, hoarding) finds over­lap­ping bio­log­ical and psy­cho­log­ical bases for consumption-​​related phe­nomena, sug­gesting the benefits of an inter­dis­ci­pli­nary approach. Our guests Scott Rick and Stephanie Preston joined us  in the studio right before the holidays to unpack these themes of societal consumption.

**Scott Rick** is an Assistant Professor in Marketing at the University of Michigan, with a Ph.D. in Behavioral Decision Research from Carnegie Mellon. He has written papers with such provoca­tive themes as “Fatal (Fiscal) Attraction; Spendthrifts and Tightwads in Marriage.”

**Stephanie Preston** is an Assistant Professor in Psychology at the University of Michigan, with a focus on cog­ni­tion and cog­ni­tive neu­ro­science. Her lab­o­ra­tory uses an inter­dis­ci­pli­nary approach to study the inter­face between emotion and decision making.  They work to deter­mine the prox­i­mate (what the brain and body are doing) and ultimate (why they exist, how they evolved) bases of the complex behaviors.

Co-​​hosts Rebecca Hardin and Kat Superfisky take us through another great hour of envi­ron­mental radio — with some smashing tunes from Madonna to Erykah Badu!
