This week on It's Hot in Here, our hosts Malavika Sahai and Chris Askew-Merwin unpack the podcast component of the  Michigan Sustainability Case (MSC) on urban farming in Detroit. They are joined in studio by Calli Vanderwilde, a Master's student in the School of Natural Resources and Environment who just finished working through this complex case study. Listen as they conduct a phone interview with Jeffrey Pituch, the Director of Development of the Michigan Urban Farming Initiative, one of the most prominent urban farming groups in Detroit. With grooves, banter, and calls from curious, engaged listeners, this is one show you don't want to miss.  For more information on this and other Michigan Sustainability Cases please visit [learnmsc.org](http://www.learnmsc.org/).
