**Bill Brinkerhoff** is the owner of [Argus Farm Stop](http://www.argusfarmstop.com) (AFS), a direct-to-consumer market for local producers, local on W. Liberty and Second Street. Argus Farm Stop strives to provide a new way for local farmers and producers to reach their customers profitably. AFS connects over 70 local farmers directly to their consumers. AFS's Mantra is "_Our future is local."_

Fun Fact: Products are OWNED and PRICED by the producer (no brokers or intermediaries allowed) so customers know where their food comes from. This is a sharp contrast to the traditional system of food sales, as evidenced by the Food Chains film, which was screened at the Ross School of Business this past Thursday. At the Local Food Summit, Laura Barch and Scott Fleck from AFS will be hosting a breakout session all about AFS's first year of operations.
