We give this episode a #2 (out of 2).

Co-hosts Audrey and Heena sat down with artist, educator, activist, and "[The POOP Project"](http://thepoopproject.org/) creator Shawn Shafner and University of Michigan Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering [Dr. Nancy Love.](https://cee.engin.umich.edu/people/nancy-g-love/) The two are experts in recycling waste, specifically the "waste" produced by our bodies.

We caught Shawn in the middle of his _[Assume the Throne](http://thepoopproject.org/assume-the-throne)_ tour. He's been on the road preaching body (and bathroom) positivity. Professor Love caught us up on her and Audrey's urine-derived fertilizers project. If you're on the UM campus, the project is accepting donations in the [GG Brown building](https://news.engin.umich.edu/2017/01/urine-fertilizer/).
