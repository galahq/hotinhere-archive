Shannon Brines and Eliot Jackson stopped by the studio to chat with regular hosts Ed Waisanen and Bella Isaacs and shamelessly plug the Local Food Summit, which — wouldn't you know it — is [happening this Saturday, February 16](http://localfoodsummit.org/).

Shannon is a local farmer and manager of the Environmental Spatial Analysis Laboratory at the UM School for Environment and Sustainability (SEAS). He's also one of the co-founders of the Summit and serves on the board of [Slow Food Huron Valley](https://www.slowfoodhuronvalley.com/).

_(Regular listeners may remember that we had a great [conversation about local food with Shannon back in November.](http://www.hotinhere.us/podcast/know-your-farmer-know-your-food/))_

Eliot is a co-leader of this year's Summit, with a day job as a research technician working on agroecology at SEAS.

They talk about the history and growth of the Summit, working towards inclusivity in the local food movement, and why they believe that anyone who eats should participate.

In the second half of the show, the four get into a heavier discussion about agroecology from both a theoretical and practical, down-to-earth perspective.
