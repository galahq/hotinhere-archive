The semester is just starting up again and we're live once more! We're still building up the student team so we returned to a classic formula: riffing on the news of the day!

_Featuring:_

Old-timer Ed Waisanen, returning champion Bella Isaacs, and proper BBC journalist Leana Hosea. We even heard from Detroiter and WCBN legend Jim "Tex" Manheim from the other side of the studio glass.

_Hits include:_<!--more-->

- The mysterious appearance of [Bird scooters in Ann Arbor](https://www.damnarbor.com/2018/09/bird-scooters-have-arrived-in-ann-arbor.html)
- Ed's poorly-thought-out plan to close most of downtown Ann Arbor to cars
- Tex remembering when seat belts first became a thing
- Leana's horror that U.S. cities site sources of air pollution in poor neighborhoods
- Bella on kayak transportation

Also, new music from Shigeto
