In this week’s episode co-hosts _Chris Askew-Merwin_ and _Malavika Sahai_ talk food and power, with a focus on corporate control over the food industry. This conversation is based on an interview we air between Malavika and guest _Phil Howard_ from Michigan State University, a professor and sociologist studying food markets and food systems. He has a new book out, entitled _Concentration and Power in the Food System: Who Controls What We Eat?_, and is perhaps most famous for his widely-circulated [infographics](https://msu.edu/~howardp/infographics.html) about concentration of ownership in the food system. They talk taking back power through consumer purchasing power and sustainable movements in pre-existing markets.

The conversation between Malavika and Phil got us thinking about a previous show we had on sustainability in the craft beer industry, from November 2015. We review a clip from the episode, [A Cultural Shift to Conservation](http://www.hotinhere.us/podcast/a-cultural-shift-to-conservation-craft-beer-in-michigan/), with Kris Spaulding of [Brewery Vivant](http://www.breweryvivant.com/) in which she discusses being a LEED certified brewery and profit sharing at Brewery Vivant.

Along with these fabulous content-rich interviews, we play some groovy tunes from Weird Al Yankovic and The Beatles.
