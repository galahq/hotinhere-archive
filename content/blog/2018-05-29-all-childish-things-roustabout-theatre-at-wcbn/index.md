Joe Zettelmaier and Joey Albright of [Roustabout Theatre Troupe](http://roustabouttheatre.com/events/) were greeted by familiar faces as they descended into the basement studios of WCBN this past Friday. It's not Joe's first time on the mic as you may remember our spooky halloween show from last fall. Hoping to steer clear of ghost-related technical difficulties this time, Joe and Joey joined regular host Ben Sonnega to talk about the upcoming rendition of [All Childish Things.](http://roustabouttheatre.com/events/)

A comedy set in a galaxy far, far away (Cincinnati, Ohio). Three life-long friends and die-hard _Star Wars_ fans, along with a less-than-enthralled conspirator, gather in a basement to plan the caper of the millennium. Together, they will steal millions of dollars worth of _Star Wars_ merchandise and memorabilia. But even the best laid plans can go awry as friendships are tested. Will the force be with them?

Whether you're a Star Wars lover or not, this isn't going to be a show you'll want to miss.
