The temperature rises in the studio as [Climate Blue](https://climateblue.org/) experts Sam Basile and Tim Arvan give their hot takes on the recent [IPCC report.](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/) Basile, a founder and former director of Climate Blue, is now a PhD candidate in Climate and Space Sciences and Engineering at the University of Michigan. Arvan is the current director of Climate Blue and an ambitious student in the Program in the Environment and Philosophy, Politics, and Economics departments. Climate Blue is a student organization at the University of Michigan that sends an observer delegation to the annual United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of Parties (UNFCCC-COP) climate talks.

A significant news item brought to the table by co-host Logan is a surprising environmental commitment made by University of Michigan President Mark Schlissel. Listen as Bella, Logan, Ed and Heena take a closer look!
