In this episode, we spoke with movers and shakers in Southeast Michigan’s local food and land conservation scene.  With the 8th Annual Homegrown Local Food Summit recently behind us, we discussed its growth over the years, and its developing importance to the community.  Lindsey Scelera shared with us some of this year's food victories as well as the victories that have come about in years past, including current Ann Arbor staples like Mark's Carts.  Keith Soster tells us more about U-M's goals for locally sourced food and what they're doing to get there, as well as how students can get involved.

There are many ways to access and start making a difference for a more food sovereign Ann Arbor, with more just access for everyone, such as the [UM Sustainable Food Program](http://www.umsfp.com/), volunteering through [WWOOFing](http://wwoof.net/), the [Michigan Young Farmer’s Coalition](http://michiganyoungfarmercoalition.org/) and more.

We also learned about the importance of preserving Michigan farmland and helping our threatened farmers with succession and business planning to hand their farms off to the next generation of food growers, instead of losing them to development. Legacy Land Conservancy is just beginning a program called [FarmNext](http://legacylandconservancy.org/emerald-arc/working-farms/) to accomplish just that.

Join Keith Soster, Director of Student Engagement for UM Dining Services, Robin Burke, Land Protection Manager at Legacy Land Conservancy, Lindsey Scalera, MI Farm to Institution Campaign Manager from the Ecology Center, Nathan Wells, Master’s Candidate and food warrior at SNRE, and your hosts, Andrea Kraus and Alex Truelove for the love of food.
