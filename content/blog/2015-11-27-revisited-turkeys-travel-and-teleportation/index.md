This week we rebroadcast an episode from the archives. [Originally broadcast](http://www.hotinhere.us/podcast/11-21-11-turkeys-travel-and-teleportation/) on November 21, 2011, back whenÂ _Itâ€™s Hot In Here_ was on Mondays, this pre-Thanksgiving episode (first of 2016!) brings up timeless questions of choices towards sustainability in your daily life.

> Just in time for the mass exodus from Ann Arbor, SNREâ€™s ownÂ Shelie Miller, aÂ specialist in life cycle assessment and energy, shares insights on sustainable transit.Â  Beyond the typical modes, she entertains our questioning of teleÂ­porÂ­taÂ­tion as surely the MOST sustainable transit form! _ğŸ˜‰_Â Turkey man and local farmerÂ John HaroisÂ is also in the studio to tell us about his magnificent birds. We hear all about why Katâ€™s dad drives from afar for these delectable pavos. A turkey slayer also calls in with the gruesome details. ItÂ _is_Â hot inÂ here!
