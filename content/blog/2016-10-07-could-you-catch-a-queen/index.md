This week with the urban bee symposium going on in Ann Arbor, we are pulling another strand into our braid of bee shows in the archive. This footage comes from outside of Toulouse, France, where Austin Martin, Taylor Landeryou and Rebecca Hardin conducted research and participant observation with a major queen rearing operation last August. Here, beekeeper Philippe Huau demonstrates to Rebecca (and her daughter) how they raise, cage, and record data about their queen bees...a hot commodity with colony collapse disorder in Europe!  Take a look...could YOU catch a queen?  Tune in Friday for our show "Country Bee, City Bee" with urban beekeeping guru Don  Shump from Philadelphia...
