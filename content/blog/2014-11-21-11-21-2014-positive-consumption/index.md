Marianna Kerppola, second-year student at U-M Erb Institute for Global Enterprise, tells about her new online business that connects consumers with clothing made with integrity. [BetterHope](http://betterhope.is/) was created to help others tell a positive story through the items theypurchase for themselves and for others. She discusses the options that are out there for shoppers this holiday season including [ThredUp](http://www.thredup.com/), another online clothing business started by U-M alum. Marianna also tells about another venture of her called [Women Who Launch](http://www.womenwholaunch.org/). This is an effort to connect female entrepreneurs, provide professional development and bridge the gender gap in business. Listen in on Marianna’s interview [**here**](https://ia801004.us.archive.org/28/items/SNREHotInHere/2014-11-21_MariannaKerppola.mp3).
