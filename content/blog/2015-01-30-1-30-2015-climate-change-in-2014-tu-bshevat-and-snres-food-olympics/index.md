**Nick Bruscato (**[bruscato@umich.edu](mailto:bruscato@umich.edu)**)** is back and talking about trees in a whole new way! You may remember **Nick** from our segment on **Urban Parks** ([http://www.hotinhere.us/1/post/2014/12/1252014-undeserved-urban-green-space.html](http://www.hotinhere.us/1/post/2014/12/1252014-undeserved-urban-green-space.html))**.** On this week's show, **Nick** joined us to discuss **Tu B'shevat,** the Birthday of Trees. **Tu B'shevat** is the 15th of Shevat on the Jewish calendar -- celebrated this year on Tuesday, February 3, 2015 until sundown on Wednesday, February, 4, 2015 --- is the day that marks the beginning of a "new year" for trees.
