Global economic meltdown got you down? Then listen in and let David Klingenberger CFO (Chief Fermentation Officer) of Ann Arbor’s own [The Brinery](http://thebrinery.com/) stim­u­late your inner economy.  
  
After an exxxtraspe­cial call-​​in from from America’s Next Top Political Pundit (and hope­fully IHIH’s newest polit­ical cor­re­spon­dent) Colin Warren, we crunch on turnips, groove on some veggie-​​themed jams and talk fer­men­ta­tion, local produce, and local business with David — a man who loves pickles even more than we do.  
  
Is all this talk of fla­vorful, crunchy, organic, local pickled veg­eta­bles making your mouth water? Then be sure to check out The Brinery @ the Ann Arbor Farmer’s Market Wednesdays and Saturdays. Your guts will thank you.  
  
xoxo,  
  
the ladies of IHIH
