Whatever your answer, we decided to start with a bit of good news. As we finished off the second week of the new year, the Hot In Here crew covered all things environmental, from the impacts of fast fashion trends to nuns karate-chopping incandescent light bulbs (full disclosure, this week's tangents were sponsored by Ed's empty stomach).

Bella covers a newly discovered fast radio burst,  which is a pulse-type signal that can be heard via radio waves and traced back to its galaxy of origin. The new signal, [FRB 180814.J0422+73,](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/second-repeating-fast-radio-burst-tracked-distant-galaxy?tgt=nr) (nice ring to it, huh?) was not only traced back to a galaxy 1.6 Billion light-years away, but it was also the second ever signal to have repeated its intergalactic sound rather than emitting just a single "blip." She then tethers us back to our home planet by reporting on the [Adrian Dominican Sisters' efforts to combat climate change](https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-environment-watch/these-michigan-nuns-are-fighting-climate-change-one-light-bulb-time). These nuns have invested _tens_ of _thousands_ of dollars in green infrastructure for their campus, which is about 70 miles southwest of Detroit.

Eager to see how the Green New Deal unfolds, Ed reveals that there will be mass action at the North American International Auto Show on January 18th at the Cobo Center. According to a [tweet](https://twitter.com/detroitdsa/status/1083011722456301569) from the Detroit DSA, the Democratic Socialists of America chapter will "be protesting GM's plant closures & calling for a just transition to a green economy." So if you're attending, be sure to report back to us via our [contact form](http://www.hotinhere.us/listen-live/) or by calling into the show.

Manageable so far, right? Well, our cortisol levels peaked when Logan hit us with some cold hard facts. According an [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/08/climate/greenhouse-gas-emissions-increase.html), by the _New York Times,_ US carbon emissions _increased_ in 2018 by 3.4%. Despite the record-breaking closures of coal-fired plants last year, increased manufacturing and the increased use of natural gas effectively negated the expected emissions reductions from the plant closures. Furthermore, Aurora unveiled some ugly truths about the fast fashion industry. According to a [recent study](https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-018-0433-7) published in the Journal _Environmental Health_ titled "The Global and Environmental Injustice of Fast Fashion," Americans buy 3.8 Billion garments annually. What's more? 85% of these ephemeral trends find their way to a landfill by the end of the year. Perhaps that's something to think twice about before we decide we _need_ the outfit we just saw on Instagram.

If you're worried about the dissonance that will ensue as you click play, we understand. Be aware that we do reveal five positive environmental facts that 2018 brought to us. Stick around 'til the end of the episode for an emotional pick-me-up.

Finally, use our [contact form](http://www.hotinhere.us/listen-live/)  to inform us of any environmental issues you'd like to hear more about. See you next time! And until then, keep it hot, keep it here.
