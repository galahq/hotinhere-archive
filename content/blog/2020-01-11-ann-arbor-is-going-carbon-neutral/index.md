In November 2019, Ann Arbor's City Council passed a resolution committing the city to becoming completely carbon neutral by 2030. Sustainability and Innovations Manager for the City of Ann Arbor, Missy Stults, talks with hosts Isabelle Brogna and Prachiti Dhamankar about [A2Zero](https://www.a2zero.org/), the city's carbon neutrality planning process. A2Zero officially kicked off in December 2019, and aims to create a plan for achieving carbon neutrality by Earth Day 2020. A2Zero is an iterative, transparent, and failure-positive process, grounded in justice and equity, that will truly be a community-wide effort. The planning process involves three core components: technical committees, partner organizations, and the public. If you'd like to share your input with A2Zero, [take a survey or host an event](https://www.a2zero.org/get-involved/)!
