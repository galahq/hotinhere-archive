Today's show was about how to end the war against the planet! We brought together activists from the 1960's anti-war movement and the modern environmental movement to commemorate the [50th Anniversary](http://sites.lsa.umich.edu/teach-in-50/) of the first [Teach-In](http://bentley.umich.edu/exhibits/dissent/teachins.php) against the Vietnam War right here at the Univeristy of Michigan in 1965. In the studio our hosts, **Sam Molnar** and **Andrea Kraus** were joined by guests; [**Tom Hayden**](http://tomhayden.com), **Richard Mann**, **Ellen Loubert**, and **Joanna Theilin**. Our mission was to find out what can the young learn from the elders? What can the elders can learn from the young? And how to stop war and climate change in one fall of the axe.

[**Tom** **Hayden**](http://tomhayden.com/) is a Michigan alum, social and political activist, author, and politician, and director of the Peace and Justice Resource Center in Culver City, California. **Tom** is best known for his major role as an anti-war, civil rights, and radical intellectual counterculture activist. He may have been the single greatest figure in the 1960s student movement. _The Nation_ magazine recently named him one of the 50 greatest progressives of the 20th century.

**Tom** was a student editor at the University of Michigan, a founding member of Students for a Democratic Society in 1961, and author of the Port Huron Statement. In 1964, **Tom** worked as a door-to-door community organizer in the inner city of Newark, New Jersey, part of an effort to create a national poor people's campaign for jobs and empowerment. During the Vietnam War, **Tom** was a leader in the anti-war movements, teach-ins, and demonstrations. In 1965, **Tom** traveled to Vietnam to meet Vietnamese people, promote peace talks and facilitate American POW releases.

After half a century of activism, politics and writing, **Tom** is still a leader in the movements against the wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan, for eradicating sweatshops, defending the environment and combatting climate change, and reforming politics through a more participatory democracy. During his time at the University of Michigan, he was a leader of the student, civil rights, peace and environmental movements of the 1960s, and went on to serve 18 years in the California legislature and senate, where he chaired labor, higher education and natural resources committees.

In addition to being a member of the editorial board and a columnist for _The Nation_ magazine, **Tom** is regularly published in the _New York Times_, _Guardian_, _Los Angeles Times_, _San Francisco Chronicle_, _Boston Globe_, _Denver Post_, _Harvard International Review_, _Chronicle of Higher Education_, _Huffington Post_ and other weekly publications. As Director of the [Peace and Justice Resource Center](http://tomhayden.com/pjrc/) in California, he organizes, travels and speaks constantly against the current wars. He also recently drafted and lobbied successfully for Los Angeles and San Francisco ordinances to end all taxpayer subsidies for sweatshops. **Tom** has also authored and edited twenty books, and he has taught most recently at UCLA, Scripps College, Pitzer College, Occidental College, and the Harvard Institute of Politics.

He was the founder of Project Outreach, an ongoing experimental Psychology program at the University.

**Richard** also edits the SUNY Press series of books in Transpersonal and Humanistic Psychology, and he has written three books, _Interpersonal Styles and Group Development, The College Classroom_ and _The Light of Consciousness._  He is the author of many autobiographical papers, files on protests against the Vietnam War, and Materials on the Program for Educational and Social Change, an effort to open University of Michigan courses to the local community in Ann Arbor.

During his time at the University of Michigan in the 1960s, **Richard** helped to organize the original 1965 Teach-In and helped to craft teach-ins and social activism protests at many other universities including Harvard. **Richard** has remained at the University of Michigan as a professor since the 1960s.
