Joe Trumpey is a farmer, sustainable designer, science illustrator, and educator. He's also the director of the University of Michigan's Sustainable Living Experience and he teaches in the STAMPS School of Art and Design as well as the School for Environment and Sustainability (SEAS) and the Program in the Environment (PitE). Is that enough to convince you he's legit?

Joe joined hosts Bella Isaacs, Aurora Aparicio, and Meg Czerwinski to talk about an open letter he's co-authored (that has yet to be published, by the way, so consider this your exclusive first look) titled "Now is the Time for All Good Faculty to Come to the Aid of Their Campus: Re-allocating Teaching, Research and Service to Achieve Campus Carbon Neutrality."  He tells us why it's important to encourage actions on both a small and large scale that help propel the University of Michigan toward a carbon-neutral existence, and how he proposes we do it.

During the second half of the show, Joe tells us about his family's ["straw-bale home,"](http://www.jtrumpey.com/project/strawbale-home/) which they constructed over the course of several years using only local, sustainable materials. Joe went on to use that same process to build a [one-room "house"](https://stamps.umich.edu/news/joe_trumpey_students_build_straw_bale_house) at the University of Michigan's Biological Station in Pellston and another up at the [Campus Farm](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2018/10/07/off-grid-um-university-michigan-straw-bale-house-sustainability/1538595002/) here in Ann Arbor. You can find more about Joe on his [website](http://www.jtrumpey.com).

We mention the upcoming Washtenaw County Climate Strike in this episode, which is taking place Friday, March 15 from 11:11AM to 1:00PM. You can find out more on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/557913254722538/), and be sure to tune in Friday, March 22 for our conversation with some of the march's co-facilitators. Until then, like we always say: keep it hot, keep it here.
