[Elders Climate Action](https://www.eldersclimateaction.org/), a ‘spinoff’ of [Elders Action Network](https://eldersaction.org/), is an organization focused on promoting the environmental activism of older folks, making sustainable behaviors more accessible, increasing the visibility of elders working in the environmental field, and providing a space for elders to organize. The organization is growing rapidly with 9 chapters around the country and several more in the process of being recognized. Founded in 2017, the Ann Arbor Chapter of ECA has focused on educating, mobilizing, and engaging with local elders and their families on several fronts. 

Joe Ohren, co-founder and chair of the Ann Arbor chapter, life-long environmental activist, grandfather of 7, retired college professor, and “amateur expert” on composting joins our hosts in the studio to discusses his role in the organization. Drawing on his years of expertise in the field of local government management and his experience with political protest, Ohren speaks on his time as a community leader and advocate. 

A key focus of the ECA Ann Arbor Chapter has been removing the barriers of participation for communities to participate in sustainability efforts and environmental activism. A prime examples would be the recent food composting project, made possible but a grant from the [Sustaining Ann Arbor Together](https://www.a2gov.org/departments/city-administrator/Pages/Sustainable-Ann-Arbor-.aspx) program. Though this project, ECA is working to increase access for local people to compost and promote education about the process. 

[Reports](https://www.usda.gov/foodwaste/faqs) have indicated that, in the United States, between 30-40% of all food produced ends up in landfills. This leads to massive amounts of waste and methane gas in landfills. A potential solution to this issue is composting, however the City of Ann Arbor currently only collects compost for 8 months of the year (mid-March to mid-December) and also exclusively serves single family homes, not commercial properties nor multifamily buildings. Furthermore, many residents remain without composting bins or the knowledge of how to compost. This campaign targets all of those issues through policy advocacy, [educational materials](https://www.eldersclimateaction.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/AA-chapter-Compost.pdf), and subsidizing composting tools. 

> "...like many people, I feel some sense of responsibility for how we got to where we are..."

Looking forward, Ohren notes that the elder community is working for the future of our grandchildren. He explains that elders may have the time, ‘the wisdom to make good decisions’, and the motivation to actively participate in change on a much wider scale than is currently acknowledged. To address this and affect change on a larger scale, ECA’s new promote the vote campaign seeks to grow political efficacy of environmentally minded non-voters to increase. The first step towards collaboration with other organizations, local engagement, effective mass mobilization, and coalition building may just be realizing that “there’s a lot of people like Joe out there.”
