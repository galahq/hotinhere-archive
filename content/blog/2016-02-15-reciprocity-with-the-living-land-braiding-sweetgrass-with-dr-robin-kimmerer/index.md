This week’s show wraps up a series of events at the University of Michigan School of Natural Resources & Environment featuring Dr. Robin Wall Kimmerer, author, teacher, and member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation. A prominent voice in botany and restoration practices, Dr. Kimmerer is the author of the books [_Braiding Sweetgrass_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17465709-braiding-sweetgrass) and [_Gathering Moss_](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/87040.Gathering_Moss). As the focus of our show this week, _Braiding Sweetgrass_ informed our conversations about the interweaving of the traditional knowledges of science, ecology, and the teaching of plants.

Dr. Kimmerer beautifully articulates the importance of recognizing multiple knowledge sources and discusses the privileges and challenges of collaborations between different ways of knowing. The dialogue addresses how we[![415GI3IIIgL._SX354_BO1,204,203,200_](images/415GI3IIIgL._SX354_BO1204203200_-214x300.jpg)](http://www.hotinhere.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/415GI3IIIgL._SX354_BO1204203200_.jpg) might work towards environmental restoration: grieving the destruction of beloved land, respecting one another, and getting our hands in the earth to move toward healing and restoring our relationship with the land. Dr. Kimmerer reads an excerpt from her book, explaining the principles of reciprocity and the responsibility of language to promote that message.<!--more-->

Along with rich conversation, this show features a line-up of beautiful and powerful songs expressing themes of justice, hope and activism. One of the featured artists, The Chippewa Travelers, have been invited to the drum competition here in Ann Arbor at the [44th annual UM Dance for Mother Earth Powwow](http://powwow.umich.edu) on April 2nd and 3rd (see the previous IHIH episode [“Dance and Divest for Mother Earth”](http://www.hotinhere.us/1/post/2014/04/04042014-dance-divest-for-mother-earth.html) for coverage of this event a few years ago).

We want to thank Dr. Robin Kimmerer for generously sharing her time, thoughts, and writing with all of us involved in producing and listening to this episode of It’s Hot in Here! For more IHIH coverage of similar topics see our previous show, [“Traditional Ecological Knowledge.](http://www.hotinhere.us/1/post/2015/04/04032015-traditional-ecological-knowledge.html)” We hope this past episode, “Reciprocity with the Living Land” is one of many conversations to be had about ways to weave traditional ecological and scientific knowledges with the teachings of plants, and we hope you tune in next week for our Love Fest and some coverage of this week's food summit.
