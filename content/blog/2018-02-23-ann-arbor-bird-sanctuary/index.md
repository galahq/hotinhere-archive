On this episode of It's Hot In Here, Andrea Aiuto of the [Bird Center of Washtenaw County](http://birdcenterwashtenaw.org/main/) joined hosts Ben Sonnega and Bella Isaacs for a casual Friday dialogue on her current work with bird rescue and how her love of birds came about.

The Bird Center of Washtenaw County primarily aims to aid birds, wildlife, and the environment through public education and rehabilitation. Trained staff help take in injured birds to be kept and rehabilitated at the center in Ann Arbor, as well as answer calls to help citizens learn what to do when an injured bird is spotted.
