This week, regular host Ed Waisanen was joined by Missy Stults ([Sustainability and Innovations Manager for the City of Ann Arbor](https://www.a2gov.org/departments/systems-planning/planning-areas/climate-sustainability/Pages/Sustainability.aspx)) and Ryan Hughes (former [Independent Candidate for Ann Arbor City Council](https://iheartryan.com/) and current host of [Civics Party on WCBN](https://app.wcbn.org/talk_shows/106)) to talk about what Ann Arbor is doing about climate change.

Together, they dug into the [Office of Sustainability and Innovation's Work Plan](http://a2gov.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&ID=6658146&GUID=714A3D9C-69CA-4DB2-B7B9-CAF3BFFD8E55), which includes some interesting and, indeed, innovative ways of reducing the City's emissions and adapting to climate impacts like increasing high-heat days and precipitation. This description isn't doing Missy's passion and energy justice so you're best-off just pressing "play."

In our conversation, Missy also mentioned the [Sustaining Ann Arbor Together Neighborhood Grant Program](https://www.a2gov.org/departments/city-administrator/Pages/Sustainable-Ann-Arbor-.aspx), which supports community projects that augment the Sustainability Action Plan, (perhaps even your own?) as well as a number of other ways to get involved beyond just recycling more.

Ryan also broke down the [vote about whether to reallocate money for climate mitigation and adaptation,](https://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/2019/04/ann-arbor-mayor-delivers-promised-veto-of-council-vote-on-new-tax-money.html) which was at the time of this recording upcoming and has now taken place.
