In January, over 30 authors published a new report on the status of the world’s primates. The title gave a bleak prognosis: “[Impending extinction crisis of the world’s primates](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/1/e1600946).” This week, co-hosts _Chris Askew-Merwin_ and _Ben Finkel_ ask why primates matter and how we can preserve them. We sat down in the studio with two Michigan primatologists and conservationists: _Dr. Andrew Marshall_, professor in the anthropology, Program in the Environment, and School of Natural Resource and Environment, and _Julie Jarvey_, member of the [Gelada Research Project](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/gelada/people/) based here at the University of Michigan.

Our conversation delves into the unique role primates play in our understanding of tropical ecology. Marshall shares with us lessons learned in his research including a new edited volume: [An Introduction to Primate Conservation](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/an-introduction-to-primate-conservation-9780198703389?cc=us&lang=en&), as wells a work in Gunung Palung National Park, Indonesia. Jarvey fills us in on what’s happening with a unique primate population on the other side of the world: the gelada monkeys of the Ethiopian highlands.

We also talk actions and solutions, from guidelines for being a tourist visiting primate countries, to being consumers here at home. Jarvey shares with us some outreach, including the hilarious and educational [Gelada Rap video](https://vimeo.com/152224929).

Between telling stories on global issues and primate behavior, we play some monkey-themed tunes from the Kinks, Simon & Garfunkel, and the Rolling Stones.
