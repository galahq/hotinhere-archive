On today's show, we bring you a conversation between regular host Ed Waisanen and Stephen Jenkinson, author, teacher, storyteller, spiritual activist, and farmer.  His most recent book, "Come of Age: The Case for Elderhood in a Time of Trouble," considers North America's paradoxical relationship with elderhood as the region's population continues to age yet fails to integrate intergenerational wisdom into its cultural consciousness during a time marked by a changing climate and sociopolitical unrest.

Stephen Jenkinson will be coming to the Eastern Michigan University's Student Center in Ypsilanti as part of his "Nights of Grief and Mystery" tour.  You can find out more about Jenkinson on his [website](https://orphanwisdom.com/).
