In this episode of It's Hot In Here, we catch up with some SNRE students who attended the Women's March in Washington, D.C. a few weeks ago.

Hosts Malavika and Chris sat down with special guests Jillian and Emily to talk about attending the march, the aftermath of it, and how they want to keep the discussion going.

With topics including from environmental justice in the new administration, feminism, and what it means to be a part of a movement, this is a must-hear episode for anyone who considers themselves socially conscious.

We hope you enjoy this edition of It's Hot in Here, and keep tuning in Fridays at noon on 88.3 WCBN-FM Ann Arbor!
