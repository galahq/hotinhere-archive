On today's show, the IHIH gang share their hot takes on what the recent midterm elections mean for the environment moving forward. Bella breaks down a special millage proposal in her native Ingham County that [protects certain farmlands and open spaces](https://www.wlns.com/news/this-morning-breakdown-of-ingham-county-proposals-before-election/1573695258) against urban development, and the Ann Arborite in the room (Ed) shares his thoughts on the city's passage of Proposal A, which nixes Mayor Christopher Taylor's deal with Chicago-based developer Core Spaces in order [to turn the city-owned Liberty Lot into an urban green space.](https://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2018/10/debate_over_ann_arbor_central_1.html) 

Heena tells us about [problems that some University of Michigan students had at the polls](https://www.michigandaily.com/section/government/students-face-voter-registration-problems-polls) after registering with TurboVote in the weeks leading up to the election, and the whole crew updates listeners on several environmentally-focused proposals nationwide that were discussed on our October 26th show, including [Florida's Amendment 9](https://www.pnj.com/story/news/2018/11/06/florida-amendment-9-voters-approve-ban-oil-drilling-vaping-indoors/1911490002/), which conveniently bans both offshore drilling _and_ indoor vaping, and [Colorado's Proposal 112,](https://www.kktv.com/content/news/Prop-112-Arguments-for-and-against-expanded-oil-and-gas-restrictions-494863501.html) which would have required energy companies to drill farther away from private homes, schools, and hospitals.
