Failure to vote is not a protest, it’s just lazy.  
  
Tune in to get a sense of the mood in DC — hear from the Michigan League of Conservation Voters on who’s greenest on your ballot — from Emily/​Judy about the role of business in sus­tain­ability and from who we hope will be America’s next top polit­ical pundit Colin Warren.  
  
Voting is sexy.
