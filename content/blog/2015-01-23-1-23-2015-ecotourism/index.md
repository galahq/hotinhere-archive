Benjamin's undergraduate degree is in Natural Resource, Recreation and Tourism, and he has done extensive research related to Ecotourism. Benjamin studied "**Sustainable Tourism**" while abroad in Australia, worked at a wildlife refuge in Costa Rica on **Ecotourism Development**, and helped to pioneer a **"Community-based Ecotourism"** initiative while serving in the Peace Corps in Ethiopia. Benjamin is currently looking into **Ecotourism** as an antecedent to environmentally responsible behavior as a thesis at SNRE.

**Will Weber** is the founder of **Journeys International** and Returned Peace Corps Volunteer. Will and his wife, Joan, founded **Journeys International** with a trek to Nepal in 1978. Will has enjoyed travel, natural history and birding in particular since childhood. Will writes: "I like to get comfortably lost in new places and find my way back by asking questions, observing the terrain and listening to environmental rhythms. I graduated from the **University of Wisconsin, Madison**, in 1970 and spent three years as a teacher and environmental specialist in the Peace Corps in Nepal. Later, I returned to the U.S. to recieve my Ph.D. in Natural Resources from the **University of Michigan**. I have been fortunate to visit most of the destinations you find on these pages, whether with my family, solo, or with a **Journeys International** group. Tune in to learn about Will's background as an SNRE student, how his company grew, and his perspective on Ecotourism and sustainability. **Journeys International Site Link,** [http://www.journeysinternational.com](http://www.journeysinternational.com)
