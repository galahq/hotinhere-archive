In this week’s broadcast, we dive into a complicated and contentious issue, discussing the increasing militarization of conservation and anti-poaching efforts on the African continent, especially as they relate to broader anti-terrorism agendas.

Host Katie Browne, accompanied by first time co-hosts Mike Burbidge and Claire Poelking, introduce this week’s topic with discussion of the new Global Anti-Poaching Act ([H.R.2494](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2494/text)), currently under debate in the US Senate, which calls for support of anti-poaching efforts, strengthening of partner country capacity to counter wildlife trafficking, and designation of major wildlife trafficking countries. <!--more-->We are then joined by call-in guest Adam Roberts, CEO of [Born Free USA](http://www.bornfreeusa.org/), a strong supporter of the bill, who argues that militarized enforcement is the only viable response to increasingly organized and well-funded poaching across the continent.

Shortly thereafter, our hosts are joined by Dr. Meredith Gore, a [conservation criminologist](http://conservationcriminology.msu.edu/) from Michigan State University, who draws upon her fieldwork in Madagascar and elsewhere in Africa to argue for the need for multidisciplinary approach to understanding poaching. Dr. Gore, whose research integrates the fields of criminal justice and natural resource management, offers a theoretical perspective on the poaching crisis as linked to broader environmental crimes and risks. Understanding these risks, she argues, is necessary to framing appropriate interventions.

Finally, our show features an interview with Dr. Jatin Dua, a socio-cultural anthropologist whose work focuses on issues of governance related to maritime piracy in the Indian Ocean. Dr. Dua contributes comments on the parallels between the international community’s response to piracy, particularly as it originates in the “failed state” of Somalia, and its increasingly militarized response to poaching in Central and East Africa. The narratives that surround failed states, Dr. Dua asserts, have their own productivity in these contexts.
