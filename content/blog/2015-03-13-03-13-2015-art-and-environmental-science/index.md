After a week long hiatus over spring break, we are back! Hope you all enjoyed your spring break as much as we did! In addition to the environmental news, views and grooves that you love, this week's show focused on **Art and Environmental Science**. Our lovely hosts, **Rebecca Hardin** ([rdhardin@umich.edu](mailto:rdhardin@umich.edu)) and **Pearl Zeng** ([zhuzeng@umich.edu](mailto:zhuzeng@umich.edu)) were joined by three interesting guestsincluding **Sara Cole, M.S.,** ([sacole@umich.edu](mailto:sacole@umich.edu)), a recent Graduate of the Behavior, Education and Communication Program at the University of Michigan SNRE and a current Communications Assistant at the University of Michigan SNRE, **Sara Anna Adlerstein Gonzalez****, Ph.D.,** ([adlerste@umich.edu](mailto:adlerste@umich.edu)) an Associate Research Scientist at the University of Michigan SNRE that has particular interests in bridging art and science, especially environmental science, she teaches courses to share her perspectives on creativity and consciousness, sustainable development in South America and messing with messy data, and **Rebecca Lambers** ([rl@rebeccalambers.com](mailto:rl@rebeccalambers.com)) a Couturière and environmentally conscious designer and owner of _Rebecca Lambers Couture_.<!--more-->

**Sara Anna Adlerstein Gonzalez****, Ph.D.,** ([adlerste@umich.edu](mailto:adlerste@umich.edu)) is an Associate Research Scientist at the University of MichiganSNRE that has particular interests in bridging art and science, especially environmental science, she teaches courses to share her perspectives on creativity and consciousness, sustainable development in South America and messing with messy data. As an Associate Research Scientist, **Sara** investigates processes at the ecosystem level using statistical modeling. Her main interest in research is to understand ecological processes and population dynamics of aquatic organisms at the ecosystem level, in particular those aspects that are relevant to resource management. Recently **Sara** has been investigating spatial and temporal scales needed to study the spatial distribution of fish abundance and obtain indices of abundance of fish populations in marine and freshwater ecosystems. Since fish, as other aquatic organisms, cannot be directly observed large scale population studies must rely on analysis of data from scientific surveys or commercial operations. The analysis of this information requires specialized statistical modeling. Currently **Sara's** focus is in the Great Lakes.

**Sara** is also the gallery organizer and curator of the University of Michigan SNRE Enviro Art Gallery: [http://www.snre.umich.edu/gallery](http://www.snre.umich.edu/gallery).  She believes that "the gallery draws attention to the intersecting values, both artistically and scientifically, of art and the environment. Because of the way SNRE’s curriculum embraces interdisciplinary fields, it is a natural place to host this gallery. We are bringing art to our school to strengthen our sense of community and facilitate dialogue among students, faculty and staff in the spirit of green-building philosophy." The Enviro Art Gallery features local and national artists whose work speaks to how people interact and understand the environment. The exhibits rotate about every eight weeks and are presented in five showcases in the Dana Building’s first floor commons.
