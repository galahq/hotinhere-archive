This week, we bring you conversations with the three co-founders of [“Food Literacy For All,”](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/sustainablefoodsystems/foodliteracyforall/) a weekly speaker series hosts experts in agriculture, food justice, sustainability, and more. Each talk is broadcast via Detroit Public Television and posted [online](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/sustainablefoodsystems/category/food-literacy-for-all/). Students at the University of Michigan can take the course for credit, but the talks are open to the public.

Catherine Badgley is a professor and Associate Chair for Undergraduate Studies in LSA's Ecology and Evolutionary Biology department, Malik Yakini is an activist, educator, and Executive Director of the Detroit Black Community Food Security Network, and Lilly Fink Shapiro is Program Manager for the Sustainable Food Systems Initiative at the University of Michigan. They sat down with regular host Bella Isaacs to discuss what inspired them to create “Food Literacy for All” and what they hope students and community members alike will learn from the series.
