Direct Air Capture (DAC) is a method of taking carbon dioxide out of ambient air. It is one solution that can work in tandem with others to slow down (and eventually reverse) the growth of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This week, host Isabelle Brogna spoke with [Dr. Christopher Jones](https://jones.chbe.gatech.edu/carbon-capture/), a Georgia Tech professor and researcher (and UM alum!) who works on the cutting edge of DAC technology. He explains how carbon dioxide is taken from the air, why doing this should be a necessary part of any plan to combat climate change, and how current and future policies and funding can help the technology.
