_Keith Taylor_, a celebrated local writer, poet, and teacher joins host _Chris Askew-Merwin_ in studio to explore nature and environmentalism through the lens of poetry. Born in British Columbia, _Keith_ shows us how his travels through some of the most remote and wild places in the world have shaped his work and his mindset. Listen as we discuss the role that art has played and continues to play in the environmental movement. However, the true pleasure of this show lies in the beautiful readings _Keith_ delivers from his latest book of poetry, _The Bird-while_.
