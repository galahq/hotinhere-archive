"Think twice before buying your feminist T-shirt from Forever 21."

Samara Almonte and Jazlyn Marcos are with the University of Michigan's [Doris Duke Conservation Scholars Program,](https://conservationscholars.seas.umich.edu) a two-summer opportunity for undergraduate students who are "interested in conservation, nature, and the environment" and "looking for a space to have discussions about diversity and inclusion" as it pertains to those fields.

Samara and Jazlyn joined host Bella Isaacs to talk about their experiences with the Doris Duke program and what brought them to the field of environmental studies. Jazlyn broke down the sustainable and ethical fashion movement and why there's an overwhelming lack of transparency when it comes to the supply chains of major retailers. Samara explained the theory of urban planning and why it's important to ensure that communities take the lead in planning and shaping themselves. The two also talked about their respective creative projects that blend media with important conversations around identity and environmental issues.
