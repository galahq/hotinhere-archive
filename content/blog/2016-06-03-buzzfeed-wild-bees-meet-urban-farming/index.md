It's summertime and our backyards are abuzz with bees!

This week we took time out to learn about the oft-overlooked wild bee.  We were surprised to learn that there are, in fact, thousands of wild bee species all around us and that, like honeybees, some of these wild species are in decline.  Our guest experts described the trials and tribulations of wild-bee research, the contribution of wild bees to agriculture, how bees do in urban areas, and how we can be better stewards to these unsung heroes (hint: don't mow your lawn!)
