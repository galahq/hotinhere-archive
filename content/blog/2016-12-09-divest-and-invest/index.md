In this week's episode of It's Hot in Here, hosts _Malavika Sahai_ and _Chris Askew-Merwin_ are joined by _Bridget Vial_, an organizer for Divest and Invest at the U of M and _Jens Lund_, a visiting scholar from Denmark to discuss the growing movement calling for institutions, cities, and countries around the world to divest their funds from fossil fuel stocks. We also chat with _Valeriya Epshteyn_, another organizer from Divest and Invest who gives us a great overview of the organization and how it fits into the larger divest movement. Hear _Jens_ talk about international efforts and listen as _Bridget_ gives us a sneak peak at what Divest and Invest are up to in the coming semester. This is a great show. Hope you all enjoy it!
