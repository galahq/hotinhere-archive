This week's environmental news, views, and grooves bring hosts Rebecca Hardin and Emily Durand to the world of social work. Through their discussions with [Dr. Lucy Lawrence](http://inside.warren-wilson.edu/includes/staff_bios.php?user=llawrence), professor of social work at [Warren Wilson College](https://www.warren-wilson.edu/) in Asheville, NC, our hosts delve deep into the environmental movements happening in the field.

Here is a little background on the field of social work: it seeks to enhance the well-being of individuals, families, and communities through direct interaction. Also, individuals in this field strive to ensure social ![IMG_2688](images/IMG_2688-300x241.jpg)welfare and security for those affected by social disadvantages such as poverty or disabilities.  This week’s show runner [Emily Durand](http://css.snre.umich.edu/person/emily-durand), pictured, has first hand experience in this area of study and the field of environmental justice.

Before arriving in her current position at Warren Wilson, Dr. Lawrence attended several institutions to continue her path in the [![llawrence](images/llawrence-200x300.jpg)](http://www.hotinhere.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/llawrence.jpg)field of social work, including Boston University and the University of Alabama. Now as head of the [Social Work Program](https://www.warren-wilson.edu/academics/social-work), Lucy teaches classes on community interactions in social work, with a special focus on Cuba, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. We spoke to Dr. Lawrence about her focus on environmental sustainability, which recognizes that the field can no longer afford to ignore the effects of environmental degradation on people and communities. This fits well with Warren Wilson’s Triad, the requirement that each student combine strong academics, work and service.

Be sure to tune in next week to find out more about the future of sustainability as we dive into the world of consumption. Also, have a wonderful holiday season and as always, keep it hot!
