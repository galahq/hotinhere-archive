This week’s episode features three University of Michigan music students discussing their spring compositions and performances. Rachel Epperly, a composition undergraduate, begins the show with a piece of hers called “Time Arrives.” Donia Jarrar spoke to us about her recent composition work, _Seamstress_. And Taya König-Tarasevich, pictured, spoke about the three flutes she’ll play in her [Masters Recital](https://events.umich.edu/event/30364).

After the live broadcast, we were able to record Taya playing another piece from her repertoire. As a bonus, you can listen to that here:
