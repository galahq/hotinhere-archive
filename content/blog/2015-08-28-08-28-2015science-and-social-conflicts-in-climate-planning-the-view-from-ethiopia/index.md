This show brings lively conversation on the challenges of climate change planning, both in Ethiopia and across the diverse governance landscapes of East and North Africa. Tied  with the [Gala case study on climate adaptation in Ethiopia](https://bit.ly/2UYDVHD)  this podcast explores the complexity of crafting effective and equitable adaptation policy. Specifically, we ask how national adaptation plans are made? By and for whom? What are the decision-making criteria? And what could these criteria fail to account for? Bringing together legal, economic, anthropological, and environmental expertise, we take adaptation policy as the starting point for broad-ranging dialogue on climate change impacts, social conflict across ethno-linguistic groups, and national planning as a tool that can either address or worsen marginalization.

<!--more--> Our hosts **Rebecca Hardin** **Katie Browne**, and **Arman Golrokhian** are joined by Returned Peace Corps Volunteer  **Benjamin Morse**, **Dr. Kelly Askew** of the Department of Anthropology and the Department of African and Afroamerican Studies (DAAS), and **Professor Laura Beny** of the Law School.  **Benjamin**’s experience working in Northern Ethiopia are riveting, especially the climate change impacts he witnessed firsthand in rural communities  **Arman** delves more deeply into the nitty-gritty of adaptation planning, specifically the criteria employed by the UN Development Program (UNDP) in selecting and prioritizing specific projects. His pre-recorded interview with **Benjamin Larroquette**, a regional technical advisor for the UNDP,  reveals the decision-making process, how environmental and development priorities are balanced, and what assumptions are built into the analysis.

“Let’s Plant a Tree,” one of a series of collaborative PSAs produced by Ben during his years with Peace Corps in Ethiopia

The discussion also draws upon the expertise of **P****rofessor Laura Beny**, who has written extensively on the challenges of governance in Sudan and South Sudan, and **Dr. Kelly Askew**, whose research has increasingly focused on land rights and economic rights of Maa-speaking peoples in Tanzania. **Dr. Beny** highlights challenges faced by the world’s youngest country, South Sudan, particularly along its borders where migration, conflict over resources, and questions of citizenship have contributed to chronic instability. Emphasizing that national plans often fail to take the interests of marginalized groups into sufficient consideration, **Dr. Beny** warns that current climate plans and projects play into broader challenges of resource access.

“Kudung Dance” by Bilpam Akech – a traditional Atuot Dinka dance song recommended by _Professor Laura Beny_

**Dr. Askew** notes the needs of pastoralist and hunter-gatherer groups are routinely disregarded in national planning, often leading to displacement, persecution, and ethnic-based violence, as has unfortunately been the recent case with the Masaai in Tanzania. Climate change poses a particular threat to such marginalized groups as changing weather patterns drive governments to expand agriculture in the name of food security, increasingly compromising access these groups’ access to rangelands and water. Both **Beny** and  **Askew**  call for greater scrutiny of the role of international institutions, who underwrite and sponsor many of the development projects which drive displacement and marginalization. These institutions, they argue, should be held as accountable as national governments for project outcomes.
