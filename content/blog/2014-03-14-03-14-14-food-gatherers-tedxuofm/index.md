For over 25 years, [Food Gatherers](http://www.foodgatherers.org/) has worked to alleviate hunger and eliminate its causes in the Ann Arbor community. Priya Khangura talks to us about Food Gatherer's innovative programs, including its food rescue operation, local food bank, school produce pantry, and farm. Listen in for some inspiration to join Food Gatherers in their fight against hunger and food waste, and visit their [volunteer page](http://www.foodgatherers.org/?module=Page&sID=get-involved) for more info.

In the second half of the show, the most excellent [Tedx University of Michigan](http://tedxuofm.com/) team joins us to offer a preview of the 5th Tedx U of M event: Against the Grain, where this year IHIH's own Jennifer Lee Johnson presents on the importance of retheorizing gender and sustainability in relation to the fishing industry on Lake Victoria.
