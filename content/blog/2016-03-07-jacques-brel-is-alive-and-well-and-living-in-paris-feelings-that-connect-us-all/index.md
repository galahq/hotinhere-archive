Remember that edgy ["out there" episode](http://www.hotinhere.us/podcast/urinetown-arts-in-our-parks-and-the-future-of-peecycling/) of Its Hot in Here where talented artists sang live tunes from the Tony Award winning musical Urinetown, while talented scientists talked to us about  research  on "peecycling" (or the recovery on nutrients from urine for use in agricultural fertilization?)  Along the way we considered infrastructure (including urinals!) in our greenways and parks, and how more art and science can be showcased in our public spaces.

Well,  they're back. For the dead of winter spring break in our studios we welcomed the talent behind the  [Penny Seats Theatre Company](http://www.pennyseats.org/)’s recent cabaret style show  _Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and Living in Paris._  Fresh from their sold out, critically acclaimed performances at the downtown pub [Connor O Neill's,](http://www.conoroneills.com/annarbor/) we head from guests including _c_ast members **Lauren London** and **Roy Sexton**, show director **Laura Sagolla**, and musical director **Richard Alder**.

[Jacques Brel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Brel) is a famous Belgian singer-songwriter who wrote his songs in French during the 1960s. Through his art he became extremely well-known in France, to the degree that the French recognize Brel the way Americans know Bob Dylan or Joni[![Jacques_Brel_Is_Alive_Cast_Recording](images/Jacques_Brel_Is_Alive_Cast_Recording-300x300.jpg)](http://www.hotinhere.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Jacques_Brel_Is_Alive_Cast_Recording.jpg) Mitchell. The show, originally produced in 1968 off broadway, is a revue of Jacques Brel's music and explores the universal emotions of love, loss, fear, obsession, and hope. Brel's work is laden with pathos, yet also lighthearted.<!--more-->

During our one hour radio show the cast and crew offer insights and takeaways from the _Jacques Brel_ _is Alive and Well and Living in Paris_ show. They go into the origin of the show and the story behind the production, including why they brought the show onto the local stage and how the music came together. **Laura** shares with us her story of being moved by Jacques Brel songs growing up, how it resonated with her and why she brought the show to the Penny Seats.  **Roy** and **Lauren**, with **Rich** playing piano in the background, bring their characters to life through on-air musical performances while also delving into their impressions of the characters they reenact. Their insights are a must hear and the tunes include _Amsterdam_, _I Loved_, _Mathilde_, _Marieke_, and _If We Only Have Love_.Learn even more from their press release: [The Penny Seats announces upcoming season](http://www.encoremichigan.com/2015/11/the-penny-seats-announces-upcoming-season/) and [Penny Seats adds a performance of “Jacques Brel” in Ann Arbor](http://reelroyreviews.com/2016/02/27/frank-weir-photographs-february-25-jacques-brel-performance/). For pictures of the show, refer to [this post on Reel Roy Reviews](http://reelroyreviews.com/2016/02/27/frank-weir-photographs-february-25-jacques-brel-performance/).

The Penny Seats produce wintertime shows  in intimate settings and summertime shows in Ann Arbor's City Parks,  in  a crusade to bring quality theatre experiences to the Ann Arbor community at or less than the cost of a movie ticket.  Two distinctly  hilarious and entertaining shows for this summer at West Park are:

- The Canterbury Tales, adapted from the book by Geoffrey Chaucer - on stage Thurs, Fri, and Sat, June 16 – July 2

- Xanadu, book by Douglas Carter Beane; Music and Lyrics by Jeff Lynne and John Farrar; the 2007 Broadway Musical Comedy Xanadu, based on the 1980 film of the same name - on stage July 7-23.
