Scrolling through his email thread, regular host Ben Sonnega was startled to see the headlineÂ _Line 5 Retirement Party!_ Is the pipeline finally being shut down for good? Time to investigate.

The Enbridge Line 5 is a controversial oil pipeline that runs directly beneath the Straits of Mackinac, and is an aging one now nearly 10 years passed its due date for replacement. A number of protests have taken place over the years, but Michigan attorney general Bill Schuette has not been critical of the pipeline. Michigan Senior Rachel Beglin is a student of the Graham Sustainability Scholars program at Michigan, and made it her business to lead on the creation of a documentary on Line 5. The documentary includes interviews and opinions from professionals in the field of science, politics, and community members near the pipeline in Northern Michigan.

Sadly, this is premature retirement party as the pipeline has not been shut down yet, but it is Rachel's informed opinion that retirement for Line 5 is on the way very soon. Check out this episode for more info on the documentary, as well as delightful discussion of responsible pipeline advocacy around the country and how to get involved in the fight for clean water in your community!
