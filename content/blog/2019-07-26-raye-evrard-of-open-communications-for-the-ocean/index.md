Raye Evrard is Project Manager for [OCTO](https://www.octogroup.org), or "Open Communications for the Ocean," an organization that serves as a global knowledge hub on sustainable ocean management and conservation. She's also the host and producer of [Salish Shes](https://www.salishshes.com), a podcast that explores "the environment, people, politics, scandals, history, and creatures of the beautiful and economically vital Salish Sea" and [OCTOPOD](https://www.openchannels.org/podcasts/octopod), OCTO's "flagship podcast" that keeps listeners "up-to-date with the latest news and research from the world of sustainable ocean management and conservation."

Raye joined host Bella Isaacs to talk about what she loves about the Salish Sea region, the ongoing effort to protect orcas in the Pacific Northwest, and her roots as an Ann Arborite and graduate of the University of Michigan's Program in the Environment.

_Editor's note: Bella makes the interesting choice to pronounce "Marxiv," OCTO's free marine research archive that is actually pronounced "mark-ive," like "Marx-ix" early on in the show. She apologizes for this._
