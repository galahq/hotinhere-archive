We discussed the annual **SNRE Chinese New Year Celebration**, that occurred this past Thursday, February 19th, 2015, in the Ford Commons of the Dana Building. This celebration of the Chinese Spring Festival included fun festivities  and lots of delicious dumplings! Festive opportunities included Chinese characters and calligraphy, Chinese games, Introduction to the Chinese Zodiac, Chinese paper cutting, and a Chinese traditional dance demonstration!

Later in the show, we discussed the **Chinese Spring Festival origins and traditions, Chinese Cuisines, Chinese Medical and Medicine, and Transportation in Beijing, China.**
