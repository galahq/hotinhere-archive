This week’s episode on _It’s Hot in Here_ highlights the 2016 Ross School of Business [iMpact Challenge](http://michiganross.umich.edu/sanger/impact-challenge) and how social entrepreneurship food ventures can address food access and affordability issues in Detroit.  

As part of Ross’s MBA orientation program, incoming students receive a 72-hour challenge to work intensely with their newly formed MBA section, to ideate, create, and pitch a profitable venture with a social mission in Detroit. It begins with a series of workshops, community conversations, team challenges, and pitch competitions that engage more than 400 students across five academic programs at Ross.

In the studio we welcome **Jeff Domagala,** Associate Director for MBA Programs at the Sanger Leadership Center, who helped create this year's iMpact challenge; **Jeff Tenza,** former IHIH host/engineer, who co-led a tour of students to interview Ann Arbor food entrepreneurs at Argus Farm Stop, Washtenaw Food Hub, and Tilian Farm Development Center.  Remaining mics were surrounded by members of the incoming winning section, Section 5: **Vaish Shastry,  Nancy McDermott, and John Barbour**.

We discuss the theme, the experience, the people, and the way a group of initial strangers developed a program which utilizes “cosmetically challenged” food to create prepared meals served on wheels.
