Established in 2009, the [Detroit Food Policy Council](https://detroitfoodpolicycouncil.net) is a 21-member   "education, advocacy, and policy organization" and advisory body to the Detroit City Council. It's primary mission is to ensure "the development and maintenance of a sustainable and equitable food system" in order to create a "food-secure City of Detroit." Unlike food policy councils in other cities, which are typically arms of the local government, Detroit's is a nonprofit that was born out of community activism and organization spearheaded by the [Detroit Black Community Food Security Network.](https://www.dbcfsn.org)

Winona Bynum is the Executive Director of the Detroit Food Policy Council. She joined regular hosts Logan Christian, Ed Waisanen, and Bella Isaacs to talk about the relationship between food policy and food justice, how the Council encourages community members from all parts of the food system to get involved in the conversation, and the main challenges — and opportunities — facing food growers in Detroit today.
