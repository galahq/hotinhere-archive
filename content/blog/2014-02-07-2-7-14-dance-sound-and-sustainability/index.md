[Jessica Fogel](http://www.music.umich.edu/faculty_staff/bio.php?u=jkfogel), a University of Michigan professor of dance and choreography, has long been interested in performance projects that bring forward stories embedded in our rural and urban landscapes. She's now collaborating with [Robert Alexander](http://www.npr.org/2013/02/10/171639280/want-to-create-a-space-symphony-wait-for-a-solar-storm), sonification specialist, and [David Biedenbender](http://www.davidbiedenbender.com/), composer, on a special site-based performance titled [Into The Wind](http://news.artservemichigan.org/2013/10/the-element-of-dance/) that explores the emotional dialogue around wind energy. Into The Wind is planned to take place in Muskegon, a town in western Michigan positioned between new and old forms of energy production in August of 2014. Jessica, Robert, and David join us in the studio to talk about their work and what we can expect from the project.

In the second half of the show, Jamie Kidwell, Ann Arbor Sustainability Associate, gets us excited about this year's various [Ann Arbor Sustainability Forums](http://www.a2gov.org/sustainability/Pages/SustainableAnnArborForum.aspx). The series will include four events organized around the [City’s sustainability goals](http://www.a2gov.org/sustainability/Pages/SustainabilityFramework.aspx). The events will be held monthly on the second Wednesday from 7 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. in the Ann Arbor District Main Library at 343 South Fifth Ave from January through April 2014. Each event will include a series of short presentations followed by a question and answer session. The forums offer an opportunity to learn more about sustainability in the Ann Arbor community.
