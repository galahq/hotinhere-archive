In this week's segment of It's Hot Out There, flautist Taya Konig-Tarasevich joins us in studio to teach our listeners about flutes. She explains the differences in pitch, sound, and history between the classical, baroque, and modern flutes, each made from distinct materias. Her visit came just before  her masters recital, In a Living Memory.  The video cannot do her immense talent justice, and is only a small and playful sample of her work, now happening at Julliard in Manhattan. How lucky we were to have her with us for a moment in Michigan!
