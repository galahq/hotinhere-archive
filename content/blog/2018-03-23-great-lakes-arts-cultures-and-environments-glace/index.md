On this episode of It's Hot In Here, hosts Bella Isaacs and Ben Sonnega to speak to Ingrid Diran and Josh Shapero, two co-facilitators of the University of Michigan Biological Station's newest course offering: [Great Lakes Arts, Cultures, and Environments](https://lsa.umich.edu/english/affiliated-programs/glace.html).

GLACE is an interdisciplinary humanities program held in Northern Michigan during the Spring half-term. Josh and Ingrid will be joined by other instructors as they teach four interconnected, two-credit courses: two in English, one in Anthropology, and one in American Culture.

The [University of Michigan Biological Station](https://lsa.umich.edu/umbs) (UMBS) is a research campus situated on Douglas Lake, amid 10,000 undeveloped acres in Pellston, Michigan. For two to six weeks, 20-25 students will work closely with the four faculty members while exploring concepts like as “place,” “natural history,” and “cultural identity” through an engagement not only with literature but also the local landscape and its inhabitants, ecologies, and histories.

In addition to formal academic work, the GLACE program experience includes creative writing, hiking, swimming, playing, and taking trips to the many natural and cultural sites in and around Pellston. GLACE students will live and work alongside student and faculty researchers in microbiology, climatology, geology, and ecology. GLACE adds a new humanistic dimension to the cross-disciplinary interactions that have long been strengths of UMBS, fostering a greater understanding of the natural world and our approaches to it.
