This week on _It’s Hot in Here_, hosts Amanda Kaminsky, Neal McKenna, and Brendan Wu discuss China-Africa relations with Dr. Omolade Adunbi, an Assistant Professor in the University of Michigan’s Department of Afroamerican and African Studies. Amanda, Neal and Brendan are all students in Dr. Adunbi’s new winter course, _When China Comes to Town: Environment and the Politics of Development_ (AAS 458)_._ The course covers Chinese foreign development policy in Africa and across the Global South.

Our show features a conversation about the social and environmental implications of Chinese infrastructural investment across the African continent. We begin by discussing Dr. Adunbi’s research on wealth distribution in the Niger Delta, which he investigates extensively in his new book [_Oil Wealth and Insurgency in Nigeria_.](http://www.amazon.com/Wealth-Insurgency-Nigeria-Omolade-Adunbi/dp/0253015731) Our conversation focuses on urban reconstruction in Lagos and Chinese investment in a new project called the [Lekki Free Trade Zone](https://www.eiseverywhere.com/file_uploads/4c89fc4ccf7b9b01305474f571ba12b3_LFZ_InvestmentGuide.pdf). Next, we examine the cultural dynamics of South Africa’s longstanding Chinese communities, drawing from a lecture given by Dr. Yoon Jung Park in New York in 2012 (watch the full lecture [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqLW6XymO9k)). Finally, we explore the economic and environmental implications of China’s rising middle class through the eyes of Amanda, Neal, and Brendan, each of whom spent several years living in China.
