Deviating only slightly from the usual environment news and grooves, regular host Ben Sonnega attended a panel discussion at the U of M Alumni Center. The topic of the panel was titled, "Navigating the Workplace: Underrepresented and Invisible Identities". The panel confronts issues of social justice and identity directly, but issues of environment and social justice are often intertwined, making this a pertinent discussion for our listeners. This episode pieces together major portions of the discussion, but is not the extent of it.Â The need to advocate for oneself has never been more relevant, especially in professional spaces as students graduate and move into the workforce, or accept an internship for the first time. Listen and learn from experiences shared by professionals and recent grads about navigating conversations on identity and some of the power dynamics that comes with it as a young professional or college intern. This episode also features music from artist [Amadou & Mariam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHJPMWtJmRM) off of the album Wati.
