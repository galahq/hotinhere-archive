This week's episode of It's Hot Out There takes us to the bar manager at Ann Arbor based Restaurant, [Sava's](http://savasrestaurant.com/), as a follow up to our "Please, Drink Sustainably" series. Managing Bartender Mike Sweet gives us the inside scoop on the Michigan based drinks served at all three of Sava Lelcaj's restaurants, the other two being [Babo](http://www.baboannarbor.com/) and [Aventura](http://aventuraannarbor.com/).

Mike eloquently discusses the touch that the mitten has had on his bar, specifically its beer, but warns of the trouble it may cause for bartender's in the state. Nevertheless, he continually celebrates the great deal of progress and versatility amongst Michigan's growing beer and spirits scenes.

For more information on all three facets of the mitten's alcohol scene, be sure to check out our [beer](http://www.hotinhere.us/podcast/a-cultural-shift-to-conservation-craft-beer-in-michigan/), [wine](http://www.hotinhere.us/podcast/michigans-wine-industry-uncorked/), and [spirits](http://www.hotinhere.us/podcast/distilled-spirits/) episodes of our "Please, Drink Sustainably" series along with our exclusive [interview](http://www.hotinhere.us/2015/11/more-beer-with-matt-gacioch/) with Matt Gacioch!

Don't forget to tune in this Friday, as we will be addressing the COP talks currently going on in the wine rich country of France! And as always, keep it hot!
