Â Ready your cups and saucers and set your kettles to boil! We're talking tea with [Sarah Besky!](http://www.sarahbesky.com/)

Sarah is a Postdoctoral Scholar with the Michigan Society of Fellows and Assistant Professor of Anthropology and Natural Resources and Environment at the University of Michigan. In her book, _The Darjeeling Distinction: Labor and Justice on Fair-trade Tea Plantations in India ([U of California Press, 2013)](http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520277397),_ Sarah narrates the lives of tea workers in Darjeeling in engaging and evocative prose to, "explore how notions of fairness, value, and justice shifted with the rise of fair-trade practices and postcolonial separatist politics in the region." _[The Darjeeling Distinction](http://www.amazon.com/The-Darjeeling-Distinction-Fair-Trade-Plantations/dp/0520277392)_ is the first book of its kind, charting a new field for examining how fair-trade operates in the context of large-scale plantation-based production.
