[Fresh Forage](https://www.freshforage.com) is a casual farm-to-table restaurant in Ann Arbor that's committed to using high-quality, sustainable ingredients sourced from local producers. Co-owners Andrew Sereno and Samuel Boyce joined host Bella Isaacs to talk about how they came up with the idea for Fresh Forage, their own experiences foraging for edible plants in the wild, the slow food movement, their future plans for the restaurant, and more.
