_Editor's note: We faced some technical difficulties with this recording, but the sound will level out after 1:07. Thanks in advance for your patience._

Ann Arbor and its 72 sister municipalities form the Huron River Watershed, meaning that every drop of water that falls in these locations makes its way back to the river one way or another. We share this water not only with our families, friends and neighbors, but also with our governments, businesses, and manufacturers. In sharing a common resource like water—the essence of life—it makes sense to have a rule book that outlines permissible and non-negotiable actions as well as provisions to guide the course of action in the event of foul play. [Michigan water quality standards](https://www.michigan.gov/deq/0,4561,7-135-3313_3681_3686_3728-350340--,00.html) fill this niche. However, as regular hosts Aurora Aparicio, Bella Isaacs, and Heena Singh learned this week from guest expert [Laura Rubin](https://www.hrwc.org/about/staff/), our rule book does not always keep pace with the discoveries of contemporary science.

Rubin is the executive director of the [Huron River Watershed Council](https://www.hrwc.org) (HRWC), a non-profit organization that conducts hydrological research on the watershed and uses those results to shape its agenda. She invited us to walk back through the history of concerns the Council has faced throughout its existence, which spans back to 1965. Over the years, the conversation has evolved from the impacts of point-source effluents (like discharge from a pipe) to those brought about by diffuse source pollution (like runoff from pavements and buildings). Climate change has become a salient theme in this discourse, too. The HRWC has identified some local impacts of climate change, like a trend of increased rainfall by 40% in spring and early summer, followed by drought periods in July and August.

The shift to more extreme patterns in local climate is a microcosm of the greater climate issue at large, and it affects more than just the moisture we can sense. Seasons of heavy rain followed by drought can contribute to concentrated pollution within the river. For instance, chemicals leeching into our watershed during a period of increased rainfall have less time to diffuse and reach concentration equilibrium throughout the river than if they were to come through a steadier influx. Of particular concern are a class of chemicals known as PFAS.

[Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl substances,](https://www.epa.gov/pfas) collectively referred to as, “PFAS” (although there are thousands), are what Rubin referred to as “emerging contaminants.” Despite that term, these chemicals are not _emerging_ at all. PFAS have been heavily used since the 1950s in manufacturing, packaging, fire-fighting foam, and other products. However, it was not until recently that we began to scrutinize their effects on human health, hence, "emerging." Although most PFAS have been phased out in the U.S., many are imported, and some of these chemicals are still in use. [According to the CDC](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/pfas/health-effects.html), PFAS have been linked to decreased immune system function, irregular hormone activity, and specific cancers. These chemicals can bind to proteins and make their way into the muscles of fish—dinner is served.

Recently, [two water sources in Michigan](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2019/02/25/state-tests-two-mich-sites-exceed-federal-level-pfas-contaminants/2980854002/) tested for PFAS concentrations above 70 parts per trillion (ppt), which is the current federally-advised lifetime limit. But Rubin mentioned that some studies have recommended much lower thresholds, and it's worth noting that [some states have set their own PFAS standards below the federal advisory.](https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-environment-watch/michigan-pfas-numbers-how-much-unsafe) While the scientific community works to reach consensus, attaching a Granular Activated Carbon or “GAC” filter to your home faucet will help reduce your risk of ingesting PFAS.

Our current state/federal legislation does not _require_ water utilities to test for PFAS levels, but that does not mean these entities are laisse-faire about them. As Rubin put it:

“In Michigan we’re in a post-Flint world, and so our legislature, our DEQ, our executive offices, they’re responding differently to these water crises… They really have responded much more aggressively to this issue, and so they’re really on the leading edge of what other states are doing.”

A main goal of the HRWC is to increase access and exposure to the river to Ann Arbor citizens. “If you want people to care about a resource, you have to let them experience it,” Rubin said. The HRWC is working diligently to encourage business ventures and plan events along the riverfront to attract citizens. It also offers internships and volunteer opportunities that allow us to participate in citizen science and develop stronger ties with the body of water that supports our everyday needs. You can check out those opportunities and register for events like "River Roundup" and "Insect ID Day" [here](https://www.hrwc.org/volunteer/). Also, get to know Laura. She may just be one of the most ebullient and optimistic guests we have had on the show.

Until next time—keep it hot, we'll stay right here.
