The remainder of the show features our guest, Dr. Mozhgan Savabieasfahani , an environmental toxicologist and global public health advocate, who discusses the impact of United States military interventions in Iraq on the health of local people. Dr. Savabieasfahani and her colleague, Dr. Muhsin Al-Sabbak, gynecologist at Basra Maternity Hospital in Iraq, recently spoke at the School of Natural Resources and Environment about the epidemic of birth defects in Iraq that may be linked to environmental contamination caused by military activity.

Dr. Savabieasfahani provides listeners with hopeful advice to public health researchers and Americans to continue the conversation of the consequences of war.
