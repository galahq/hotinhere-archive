With the first segment in our New Series, It's Hot Out There, Harry Rice interviews SNRE and Ross School of Business Masters Student, Matt Gacioch. This interview is a continuation of our show on beer last Friday, and Matt's experience at [Short's Brewing](https://www.shortsbrewing.com), [Left Hand Brewing](http://lefthandbrewing.com), and the [Brewer's Association](https://www.brewersassociation.org) provide more great insight on the industry, much of which we did not cover in last week's episode.

Give it a listen to hear more about the work Matt did at those locations, the importance of malt in the brewing process, and the craft beer revolution.

Thanks to [Arbor Brewing Company](http://www.arborbrewing.com) for allowing us to conduct the interview in their Ann Arbor location.
