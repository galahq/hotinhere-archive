Matt Harmon, Tegwyn John, and Solomon Medintz are members of the [Climate Action Movement](https://www.climateactionmovementuofm.org/home) at the University of Michigan, which defines itself as "a coalition of stakeholders" that is urging the university to craft a meaningful sustainability policy and actively move its campus toward carbon neutrality. They were also co-organizers of last week's [Washtenaw County Climate Strike](http://tinyurl.com/climatestrikewc), a county-wide protest spearheaded by high school and college students that "demanded better and immediate policy from Washtenaw County City Councils" and the University of Michigan.

Matt, Tegwyn, and Solomon joined hosts Bella Isaacs, Ed Waisanen, and Logan Christian in the studio to talk about the steps that CAM wants the university to take on the path toward carbon neutrality, the role that young people are playing in the global movement to confront climate change, and their own experiences at the climate strike.
