**[U-M Native American Student Association Hosts 40th Annual Dance for Mother Earth Powwow](http://powwow.umich.edu/home)** On April 4 & 5, 2015 at Skyline High School in Ann Arbor. The Dance for Mother Earth Powwow is hosted by the [UM Native American Student Association](https://www.facebook.com/NASAatUMich), with assistance by the EMU NAISO. At the Powwow, thousands of people from Michigan, across the U.S., and Canada gather to celebrate and learn about Native American culture and traditions. Forty years after a small group of Native American students and community members founded the annual Dance for Mother Earth Powwow in Ann Arbor, it has evolved into a popular community-wide event hosted by the Native American Student Association at the University of Michigan.
