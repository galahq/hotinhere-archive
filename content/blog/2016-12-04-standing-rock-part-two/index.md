In the second installment of our conversation on Standing Rock we hear about what it's really like to be on the ground in the camp. First, correspondent _Leana Hosea_ speaks with water protectors at the camp who discuss police presence on the ground and morale as they continue to defend their land. We also listen to some live music from the site. Then, School of Social Work Students _Anna Lemler_ and _Maria Ibarra_ join hosts _Chris Askew-Merwin_ and _Malavika Sahai_ to discuss their experience visiting the Standing Rock camp. They delve into some of the politics of colonization, the negative impact some white activists have had on the camp, and talk about the role that non-Native demonstrators have in the Dakota Access Pipeline struggle. _Anna_ and _Maria_ recently visited the camp and donated supplies collected from University of Michigan students and had firsthand experience working on projects following indigenous leadership on-site. These are some personal accounts you won't want to miss!
