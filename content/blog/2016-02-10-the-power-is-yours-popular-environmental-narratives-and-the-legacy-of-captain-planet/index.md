This week we took a break from the [exciting](http://www.hotinhere.us/2016/01/maintaining-the-lions-den-with-craig-packer/)\-but-[heavy](http://www.hotinhere.us/podcast/financing-biodiversity-conservation-the-case-of-the-birds-head-seascape/) [subject matter](http://www.hotinhere.us/podcast/last-animals-lasting-solutions-lions-the-last-animals-and-conservation-strategies/) that has occupied the It's Hot in Here crew as of late, in order to mull-over the legacy of Captain Planet--perhaps the most recognizable environmentally-themed character of the 21st century, the product of a children's television show no less!

Although the show ceased production in the mid-90s, our blue-skinned, green-haired hero still pops-up at Halloween parties and climate rallies to this day.  What should we make of Captain Planet's legacy?  Is the show just a cheesy relic from the heyday of Saturday morning cartoons or can it also offer us a meaningful glimpse of popular environmentalism's past and present?

To this end, we sat down with three environmental thinkers to ponder clips from the show:<!--more-->

\[In the segment we also mentioned a briefing by the [Union of Concerned Scientists](http://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear-power#.VrkPS_krLWI)\]
